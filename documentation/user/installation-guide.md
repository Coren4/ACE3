This guide will explain how to get ACE3 up and running faster than you can say banana.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Download [CBA](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=18767).

- Know how to extract .zip files. Use [Google](https://www.google.com) if not sure.

## 3. Install ACE3
- Extract both CBA and ACE3 .zip files into your Arma 3 folder. By default this is located in:<br>
32-Bit - `C:/Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Arma 3/`<br>
64-Bit - `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/Steamapps/Common/Arma 3/`
- After extraction you should have the `@ace` and `@CBA_A3` folders inside your Arma 3 folder.

### 4.1 What do they do?
Optional components supplement 3rd party mods with ACE3 features, for example:
- Optional weapon components make Advanced Ballistics possible, as well as the ability to use ACE3 weapon attachments with 3rd party weapons like RHS, HLC, etc.
- Optional tracers component brings back ACE2 ball tracers.
- Optional server component is used to load the userconfig files.

### 4.2 Which optionals should I use?
Only use the optional components that correspond with your mod-pack.

### 4.3 How to install these components?
- Inside your `Arma 3/@ace/` folder, you'll find the `optionals` and `addons` folders.
- Copy and paste the relevant `.pbo` and `.bisign` files from the `optionals` folder into the `addons` folder.
- Copy and paste the `userconfig` folder from the `optionals` folder into root `Arma 3` folder.

## 5. Launch Arma 3 with ACE3
